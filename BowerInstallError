I was working on a ASP.NET core project and then I needed to add a bower dependency, and as it turned out I hadn't installed bower 
before. So I Innocently googled how to install bower and then executed this command:

npm install -g bower

I saw a terminal download counter and then a message that I had successfully installed it.

At the end of the article I was told to execute this:

bower -v 

The expected result would be the version of bower, but instead I got this:

module.js:329
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module './lib/js-yaml.js'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:327:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:278:25)
    at Module.require (module.js:355:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:13:17)

    at Function.Module._load (module.js:302:12)
    at Module.require (module.js:355:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:13:17)

I tried :

npm install -g js-yaml

And I got the same install screen and that everything was ok, but alas, executing bower -v produced the same error

Then I decided to get smart, the error said "'./lib/js-yaml.js'"

So I searched for the js-yaml repository which is NOT the same as YAML.js btw, and sure enough it was here
https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml

now all I did was download it, and extract the files, then install them in the Bower path where it was expected

/usr/local/lib/node_modules/bower/node_modules/configstore/node_modules/js-yaml/lib

And then it worked!
