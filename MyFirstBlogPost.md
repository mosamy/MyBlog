                            Hello MoSamy's Github blog


Ever since I started using Github I have been thinking. Why hasn't anyone used this as a blogging platform yet?

I mean you can link to code, you can have articles with versions and people can even download the articles and synch
their clone of your blog if it becomes that important to them. 

I also see the following features to be used for greta potential:

1. You can have discssions and comments on a specific part of an article.

2. You basically have text and no crappy ads to turn you off.

3. It is lighter than wordpress.

4. If you need to do fancy editing like highlighting and underligning or inserting pics a Wiki is a great option.

5. What would be more Geeky than having your blog on Github?


I would be really interested in your thoughts regarding this.

BR,
MoSamy
