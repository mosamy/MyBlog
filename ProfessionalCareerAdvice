I am writing this post not as an authority on career advice or even considering myself a career guru. This is mainly about observations I have made during my 15+ year career working in the IT industry across four of the seven continents. I have had a career of varying levels of success at different times in my life. I would however consider myself a success because I have managed to stay employed almost continuously over the last 15 years and have successfully managed to work as an architect various levels of seniority in some of the top IT companies in the EMEA region and beyond.
